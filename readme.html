		<h2>Intro</h2>
			This is a javascript simulator of the DCPU-16 CPU as released by Notch in early April 2012. <a href="http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt">The full spec can be found here</a>.<br />
			I tried to fully test the CPU. You can find the tests in:  tests.html
			The keyboard buffer spec is taken <a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=aJSkRMyC">from this example code released by Notch.</a><br />
			The screen spec is taken <a href="http://i.imgur.com/XIXc4.jpg">from this example released by Notch.</a><br />
			Thanks to eveilpie which code from the <a href="https://gist.github.com/2300590">javascript disassembler</a> I use in some places. <br />
			
			<h3>Known issues:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>JSR not implemented yet</li>
				<li>The online assemblers assemble this line "set a, 1" into 8401, that doesn't work right yet, instead use: 7c01 0001 </li>
			</ul>
		<h2>What is DCPU-16?</h2>
		<p>
			Recentlu Notch (of Minecraft fame) anounced his new game:<a href="http://0x10c.com/">0x10c</a>. It is a space game. In this game you control your ship via a computer. This computer is the dcpu-16 
			and is fully programmable. Notch released the spec and a lot of tools have been released in the days after. This is one such a tool.
			Primarly created for the fun of it :).
